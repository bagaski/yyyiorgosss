This is a CV and basic portfolio website I did for myself.
I used css grid for the layout and some basic Javascript to animate the intro text.

The main purpose of the website is two-fold: 
I want to practise my css and html skills with a real project - I need a basic portfolio and cv website to send with my job applications.
